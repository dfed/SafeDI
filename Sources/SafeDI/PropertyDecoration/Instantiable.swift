/// Marks a type as capable of being instantiated by the SafeDI system.
///
/// A `class`, `struct`, or `actor` type declaration decorated with `@Instantiable` makes the type capable of having properties of other `@Instantiable`-decorated types injected into its initializer.
///
/// Example:
///
///     @Instantiable
///     public final class FirstPartyType {
///         public init(createdDependency: Dependency, receivedDependency: Dependency) {
///             self.createdDependency = createdDependency
///             self.receivedDependency = receivedDependency
///         }
///
///         /// A dependency instance that is instantiated when the `FirstPartyType` is instantiated.
///         @Instantiated
///         private let createdDependency: Dependency
///         /// A dependency instance that was instantiated further up the dependency tree.
///         @Received
///         private let receivedDependency: Dependency
///     }
///
/// An extension declaration decorated with `@Instantiable` makes the extended type capable of having properties of other `@Instantiable`-decorated types injected into it. Decorating extensions with `@Instantiable` enables third-party types to be instantiated by the SafeDI system.
/// Usage of this macro requires the extension to implement a method `public static instantiate() -> ExtendedType` that defines the instantiation logic for the externally defined type.
///
/// Example:
///
///     @Instantiable
///     extension ThirdPartyType {
///         public static func instantiate() -> ThirdPartyType {
///             // Implementation returning an instance of ThirdPartyType
///         }
///     }
///
/// - Parameter additionalTypes: The types (in addition to the type decorated with this macro) of properties that can be decorated with `@Instantiated` and yield a result of this type. The types provided *must* be either superclasses of this type or protocols to which this type conforms.
