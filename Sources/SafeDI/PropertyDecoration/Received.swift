/// Marks a SafeDI dependency that is instantiated or forwarded by an `@Instantiable` instance higher up in the dependency tree.
///
/// An example of the macro in use:
///
///     @Received
///     private let dependency: DependencyType
///
/// Note that the access level of the dependency in the above example does not affect the dependency tree – a `private` dependency can still be `@Received` by `@Instantiable`-decorated types further down the dependency tree.

/// Marks a SafeDI dependency that is instantiated or forwarded by an `@Instantiable` instance higher up in the dependency tree whose name and/or type is being changed from the dependency‘s initial declaration.
///
/// Two examples of the macro in use:
///
///     @Received(fulfilledByDependencyNamed: "dependency", ofType: "DependencyType")
///     private let renamedDependency: DependencySuperType
///
///     @Received(fulfilledByDependencyNamed: "dependency", ofType: "DependencyType", erasedToConcreteExistential: true)
///     private let typeErasedDependency: AnyDependencyType
///
/// Note that the access level of the dependency in the above example does not affect the dependency tree – a `private` dependency can still be `@Received` by `@Instantiable`-decorated types further down the dependency tree.
///
/// Renamed and retyped dependencies can be `@Received` by their new name and type by `@Instantiable` types further down the dependency tree.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - fulfilledByDependencyNamed: The name of the property belonging to an `@Instantiable` instance higher up in the dependency tree whose name and/or type is being changed from the dependency‘s initial declaration.
///   - concreteType: The type of the property belonging to an `@Instantiable` instance higher up in the dependency tree whose name and/or type is being changed from the dependency‘s initial declaration.
///   - erasedToConcreteExistential: Whether the concrete type is being erased to a concrete existential type – a type that encapsulates a value conforming to a protocol without revealing the underlying type. Set this parameter to `true` to encapsulate the renamed or retyped instance of `concreteType` in a no-label initializer of the property’s type (e.g. `AnyDependencyType(dependency)`).
